#Meme -Generator

This is an Web App designed using React.js(a frontend Framework in javascript).
It uses an API end-point("https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes") to fetch random meme images without any text written on them.
With the help of input text that we can provide using the text box present in UI,we complete the meme as that text is displayed at the top and bottom of image.
